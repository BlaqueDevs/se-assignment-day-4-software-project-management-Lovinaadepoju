## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
ANSWER: Defining the project scope contributes to successful project planning sets the foundation for the entire project.  It contributes to the successful project planning as follows:
-	Clear objectives and deliverables
-	Prevent uncontrolled expansion of a project’s scope due to unplanned changes or additions.
-	A well-defined scope helps in accurately estimating the resources required to complete the project.
-	It allows for the development of realistic timelines and milestones.
-	It is a benchmark for measuring project success and allows for objective evaluation to ascertain if the project meets the objective and deliverables within the specified parameters.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, more manageable components or work packages.  It breaks down the project’s scope into detailed tasks, activities and deliverables, organized into levels that represent different stages of the project.
WBS is useful for project organization, enhance planning and scheduling and resource allocation.  It also improves communication, risk management, tracking and control.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
ANSWER:  Below are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule:
-	Improved time management
-	Resource optimization
-	Enhanced communication
-	Risk management
-	Prioritization of tasks
-	Monitoring and control
-	Facilitates accountability
-	Milestone tracking
A Gantt Chart is used in project management to plan, schedule and track the progress of a project.  Gantt Chart assist in the following process:
-	Visual representation of the project timeline
-	Allows for task breakdown and sequencing
-	The chart shows the dependencies between tasks 
-	Can be used to map resources to specific tasks
-	Important and relevant milestones can be marked on a Gantt chart.
-	It has features that allows for tracking the progress of project.
